title: Greater Palm Springs
description: Palm Springs eternal. Thatâ€™s how the saying goes, right? It's certainly hard to tire of Greater Palm Springs and its nine beautiful cities, known for helping to relax, revive and energize those lucky enough to visit. Spend a few days trekking through Joshua Tree State Park, sampling the healthful farm-to-table fare on North Palm Canyon Drive and bathing in the geothermal mineral waters of Desert Hot Springs, and we think you'll agree there's something timelessly appealing about this one-of-a-kind desert oasis.
